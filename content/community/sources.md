## Using GitHub

The source code is mirrored to GitHub, so you can also check out the source code from GitHub,
if you are familiar with using GitHub.

By using GitHub, you can submit pull requests to the project using the standard GitHub way.

```
https://github.com/apache/camel/
```

## Checking out from git

```
git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/camel.git
```

Only project developers can commit to git via this method.
SSH must be installed on your client machine.
Enter your site password when prompted.
