## Mailing Lists

*Use Camel User List*

You should post and subscriber to the Camel User List for all your questions on using Camel, or how to do X with Camel etc. If in doubt use this list.
The other list Camel Developer List, is for the Camel team to discus development of the actual Camel project; do not use this list for question on using Camel.
Again to re-iterate, use the Camel User List, for you Camel questions. This is the correct mailing list, and have the most people there ready for helping you.

*Post plain text mails*

When posting to the mailing lists, use plain text mails. Do not use HTML mails. HTML mails is more likely to be targeted as spam mails and will be rejected; as well it's not easily readable by others.
