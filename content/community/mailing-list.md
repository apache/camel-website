## Use Camel User List

You should post and subscribe to the Camel User List for all your questions on using Camel, or how to do X with Camel etc. If in doubt use this list.
The Camel Developer List, is for the Camel team to discus development of the actual Camel project; do not use this list for questions on using Camel.
Again to re-iterate, use the Camel User List, for your Camel questions. This is the correct mailing list, and has the most people there ready for helping you.

## Post plain text mails

When posting to the mailing lists, use plain text mails. Do not use HTML mails. HTML mails is more likely to be targeted as spam mails and will be rejected; as well it's not easily readable by others.
