## Web Browsing of git

To browse via the web:

```
https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=camel.git
```

## Web Browsing Using FishEye

A hearty thanks to [Atlassian](http://atlassian.com/) for providing [FishEye](http://cenqua.com/fisheye/) hosting for Camel. Below is the URL to browse the Subversion repo via FishEye:

```
https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/browse/camel-git
```

## Checking out from git

```
git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/camel.git
```

Only project developers can commit to the git via this method. SSH must be installed on your client machine. Enter your site password when prompted.

## Using github

The source code is mirrored to github, so you can also checkout the source code from github, if you are familiar with using github. By using github you can submit pull requests to the project using the standard github way.

```
https://github.com/apache/camel/
```

## Building the code

To then build the code see [Building](/docs/building).
