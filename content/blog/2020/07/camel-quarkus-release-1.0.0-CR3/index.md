## Camel 3.4.0

Camel was upgraded to [3.4.0](/blog/2020/06/camel34-whatsnew/). For Quarkus this brings some performance improvements, 
with JAXB dependencies having been removed from the OpenAPI components. There's also some enhancements to the health check APIs and a new 
[health example](https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/tree/master/examples/health) was added to demonstrate this.

## Quarkus 1.6.0.Final

Quarkus was upgraded to 1.6.0.Final.
