preview: How to write a command line utility with Camel Quarkus
---

[Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) and [Camel Quarkus](https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/index.html) are
typically used to create integration applications that run as long living processes, a.k.a. daemons or services.
In this blog post, we are going to explain a slightly different use case: using Camel Quarkus in programs that exit by
themselves after performing some desired tasks.

## Where can this be useful?

The enterprise is full of scheduled batch processing. Say, some system exports some sort of reports daily at 4 a.m.
Those need to be transformed (e.g. XML -> Excel) and transferred somewhere else (e.g. via mail, FTP or similar).

Camel is a perfect match for doing the transformation and the transfer. However, having a service running 24/7 for
doing something useful just once a day would probably be an overkill. Combining a
[Cron job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) (or a similar scheduling technology) with a command line utility may suit
much better in situations like this.

## So how can I write a command line tool with Camel Quarkus?

There are just two things where it would differ from a stock Camel Quarkus application:

1. Adding `camel-quarkus-main` dependency
2. Setting an exit condition in `application.properties`

The rest of the application - most notably the [Route](https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/routes.html) that
performs the actual data transformation and transfer - will look the same like with a traditional Camel service.


## A minimal Hello World!

Let's go through a minimal example that just prints `Hello World!` to the console and exits.

The route definition could look like the following:

```java
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

@ApplicationScoped
public class CamelRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from("timer:hello?delay=-1&repeatCount=1")
                .setBody().constant("Hello World!")
                .to("log:hello");
    }
}
```

Note that we use the [timer](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/timer-component.html) component to trigger the
route execution. The URI parameter `delay=-1` causes the timer to be triggered with no initial delay and
`repeatCount=1` ensures that the route is executed just once.

However, doing just the above would not make our application exit by itself.
[camel-main](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/others/main.html) and its `camel.main.durationMax*`
family of configuration options offers a way to solve that. E.g. we can set the following in
`application.properties`

```properties
camel.main.durationMaxMessages = 1
```

to make the application exit after the route has processed a single message.

For the configuration to get effective, we need to add the respective dependency to the application. In case of Maven,
it is

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-main</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Of course, we also need to add the dependencies for `timer` and `log` components:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-log</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-timer</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

When invoking the application on the command line, you should see something like the following:

```shell

```


## Command line parameters

That was really trivial. How about greeting a person whose name is passed via a command line parameter? We can use
[Quarkus MicroProfile Config](https://quarkus.io/guides/config) for that:

```java
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;

@ApplicationScoped
public class CamelRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    @ConfigProperty(name = "greeted.subject", defaultValue = "World")
    String greetedSubject;

    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from("timer:hello?delay=-1")
                .setBody().constant("Hello " + greetedSubject + "!")
                .to("log:hello");
    }
}
```

For the `@ConfigProperty` annotation to work, the `CamelRoute` class needs to be annotated with
`@ApplicationScoped`.

Having the above in place, we can call the application with the `-Dgreeted.subject=Joe` parameter at the command
line and voil√†

```shell

## Compiling the command line utility to a native executable

[As usual with Camel Quarkus](https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/user-guide/first-steps.html#_native_mode),
the application can be compiled to native executable by activating the `native` profile.
GraalVM with `native-image` command installed and `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable set is required for that,
see [Building a native executable](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image) section of the Quarkus
documentation.

```shell
$ export GRAALVM_HOME=...
$ mvn clean package -Pnative
...
$ ls -lh target
...
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 ppalaga ppalaga  33M Jul 15 11:48 command-mode-runner
...
```

The basic command line application compiled into a Linux native executable has about 33 Megabytes.

Running it is easy:

```shell

## Show me the code!

The sources of the application used in this blog post are based on the `main-command-mode` integration test in
the Camel Quarkus source tree: https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/tree/master/integration-tests/main-command-mode

Bonus: The integration test module shows a way how to test command line applications.

Have a lot of fun!
