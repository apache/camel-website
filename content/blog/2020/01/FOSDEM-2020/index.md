You'll find over 800 talks spread over 35 rooms of Université libre de Bruxelles campus over the first weekend of February. And building on last year's well-received BoF session Camel is returning to FOSDEM.

# Why

Aside from all the [interesting talks](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/), your favorite even-toed ungulate is going to be represented there.

First, at the _Integration Process Community_ [stand](https://fosdem.org/2020/stands/) in the building K both days of the conference. Come by to say hi, learn from the Cameleers about all the new and exciting developments on Camel 3, Camel K, Camel Quarkus and Camel Kafka Connector. There might even be some Camel swag for you to grab :)

The Camel BoF session at FOSDEM 2019 was very well received last year and we're repeating it: the [Camel birds of a feather](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/bof_apache_camel/) will be on Saturday from 11 to 12 in the room [H.3242](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/buildings/#h). Let's meet, discuss and exchange ideas. Anyone wishing to share can present on any topic relating to Apache Camel is welcome to do so, though please be mindful of the time - we have one hour in this session and would like that everyone would have the chance to participate.

On Saturday evening, first day of FOSDEM, we have the social event, a chance to wind down and discuss more about Camel at À la Mort Subite a old traditional pub and brewery in the Brussels city center.

I hope to see many of you at FOSDEM 2020!
