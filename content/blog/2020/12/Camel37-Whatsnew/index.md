Apache Camel 3.7 LTS has just been released.

This is a LTS release which means we will provide patch releases for one year. The next planned LTS release is 3.10
scheduled towards summer 2021.

## So what's in this release

This release introduces a set of new features and noticeable improvements that we will cover in this blog post.

### Pre compiled languages

We continued our avenue of making Camel faster and smaller. This time we focused on the built-in Simple scripting
language.

First we added the [jOOR language](/components/next/languages/joor-language.html). jOOR is a small Java tool for
performing runtime compilation of Java source code in-memory. It has some limitations but generally works well for small
scripting code (requires Java 11 onwards).

Then we worked on compiled simple.

### Compiled Simple

The [csimple language](/components/next/languages/csimple-language.html)
is parsed into regular Java source code and compiled together with all the other source code, or compiled once during
bootstrap via jOOR.

In a nutshell, compiled simple language excels over simple language when using dynamic Object-Graph Navigation
Language (OGNL) method calls.

For example profiling the following simple expression

    <simple>${exchangeProperty.user.getName} != null && ${exchangeProperty.user.getAge} > 11</simple>

with the equivalent csimple expression:

    <csimple>${exchangeProperty.user} != null &&
             ${exchangeProperty.user.getName()} != null &&
             ${exchangeProperty.user.getAge()} > 11</csimple>

yields a dramatic 100 times performance improvement in reduced cpu usage as shown in the screenshot:

For more information about the compiled simple language and further break down of performance improvements then
read [Claus blog post](http://www.davsclaus.com/2020/12/apache-camel-37-compiled-simple.html).

We have provided two small examples that demonstrate `csimple` as pre compiled and as runtime compiled during bootstrap.
You can find these two examples from the official Apache Camel examples repository at:

- [csimple pre compiled example](https://github.com/apache/camel-examples/tree/master/examples/camel-example-csimple)
- [csimple runtime compiled example](https://github.com/apache/camel-examples/tree/master/examples/camel-example-csimple-joor)

### Optimized core

We have continued the effort to optimize camel-core. This time a number of smaller improvements in various areas such as
replacing regular expressions with regular Java code when regular expressions were overkill
(regexp take up sizeable heap memory).

The direct component has been enhanced to avoid synchronization when the producer calls the consumer.

We also enhanced the internals of the event notifier separating startup/stop events from routing events, gaining a small
performance improvement during routing.

We also reduced the number of objects used during routing which reduced the memory usage.

Another significant win was to bulk together all the type converters from the core, into two classes (source generated).
This avoids registering individually each type converter into the type converter registry which saves 20kb of heap
memory.

If you are more curious about how we did these optimizations and with some performance numbers,
then [Claus wrote a blog post](http://www.davsclaus.com/2020/11/apache-camel-37-more-camel-core.html).

### Optimized components startup

The camel core has been optimized in Camel 3 to be small, slim, and fast on startup. This benefits
[Camel Quarkus](/camel-quarkus/next/) which can do built time optimizations that take advantage of the optimized camel
core.

We have continued this effort in the Camel components where whenever possible initialization is moved ahead to an
earlier phase during startup, that allows enhanced built time optimizations. As there are a lot of Camel components then
this work will progress over the next couple of Camel releases.

### Separating Model and EIP processors

In this release we untangled model, reifier and processors.

This is a great achievement which allows us to take this even further with design time vs runtime.

    Model    ->    Reifier   ->   Processor
    (startup)      (startup)      (runtime)

The model is the structure of the DSL which you can think of as _design time_ specifying your Camel routes. The model is
executed once during startup and via the reifier (factory) the runtime EIP processors is created. After this work is
done, the model is essentially not needed anymore.

By separating this into different JARs (camel-core-model, camel-core-reifier, camel-core-processor) then we ensure they
are separated and this allows us to better do built time optimizations and dead code elimination
via [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) and/or GraalVM.

This brings up to lightweight mode.

### Lightweight mode

We started an experiment earlier with a lightweight mode. With the separation of the model from the processors, then we
have a great step forward, which allowed us to make the lightweight mode available for end users to turn on.

In lightweight mode Camel removes all references to the model after startup which causes the JVM to be able to garbage
collect all model objects and unload classes, freeing up memory.

After this it's no longer possible to dynamically add new Camel routes. The lightweight mode is intended for
microservice/serverless architectures, with a _closed world_ assumption.

### Autowiring components

The Camel components is now capable of autowiring by type. For example
the [AWS2 SQS](/components/next/aws2-sqs-component.html) components can automatically lookup in the registry if there is
a single instance of `SqsClient`, and then pre configure itself.

We have marked up in the Camel documentation which component options supports this by showing *Autowired* in bold in the
description.

### Salesforce fixes

Our recent Camel committer [Jeremy Ross](https://github.com/jeremyross) did great work to improve and fix bugs in
the [camel-salesforce component](/components/next/salesforce-component.html). We expect more to come from him.

### VertX Kafka Component

A new Kafka component has been developed that uses the Vert.X Kafka Java Client which allows us to use all of its
features, and also its robustness and stability.

The [camel-vertx-kafka](/components/next/vertx-kafka-component.html) component is intended to be (more) feature
complete with the existing camel-kafka component. We will continue this work for the next couple of Camel releases.

### DataSonnet

The new [camel-datasonnet](/components/next/languages/datasonnet-language.html) component, is to be used for data
transformation using the [DataSonnet](https://datasonnet.com/) standard.

DataSonnet is an open source JSON-centric, template-based data transformation standard built to rival proprietary
options available in the market.

### Spring Boot

We have upgraded to Spring Boot 2.4.

### New components

This release has a number of new components, data formats and languages:

- [AtlasMap](/components/next/atlasmap-component.html): Transforms the message using
  an [AtlasMap](https://www.atlasmap.io/) transformation
- Kubernetes Custom Resources: Perform operations on Kubernetes Custom Resources and get notified on Deployment changes
- Vert.X Kafka: Sent and receive messages to/from an Apache Kafka broker using vert.x Kafka client
- JSON JSON-B: Marshal POJOs to JSON and back using JSON-B
- CSimple: Evaluate a compile simple expression language
- DataSonnet: To use DataSonnet scripts in Camel expressions or predicates
- jOOR: Evaluate a jOOR (Java compiled once at runtime) expression language

## Upgrading

Make sure to read the [upgrade guide](/manual/camel-3x-upgrade-guide-3_7.html) if you are upgrading to this
release from a previous Camel version.

## More details

The previous LTS release was Camel 3.4. We have blog posts for what's new in
[Camel 3.5](/blog/2020/10/Camel36-Whatsnew/) and
[Camel 3.6](/blog/2020/09/Camel35-Whatsnew/) you may want to read to cover all news between the two LTS releases.

## Release Notes

You can find more information about this release in the [release notes](/releases/release-3.7.0/), with a list of JIRA tickets resolved in the release.
