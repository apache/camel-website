We're happy to announce that our little caravan has been enriched by two new committers. The Camel project warmly welcomes [Jiri Ondrusek](https://github.com/JiriOndrusek) and [Jeremy Ross](https://github.com/jeremyross).

[Jiri Ondrusek](https://github.com/JiriOndrusek)'s has been contributing to Camel, Camel Spring Boot, and Camel Quarkus for a while now, and [Jeremy Ross](https://github.com/jeremyross) has been doing stellar work on the Salesforce component, his expertise in Salesforce will help us keep up with frequent changes made on that platform.

We are very happy with the sustained growth of the project and look forward to continued contributions from the community and adding to our committer pool. If you're wondering how one becomes a committer, we have a handy page [on becoming a committer](/manual/latest/faq/how-do-i-become-a-committer.html) prepared for you to go through.
