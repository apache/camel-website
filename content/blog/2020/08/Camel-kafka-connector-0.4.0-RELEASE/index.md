We recently released camel-kafka-connector 0.4.0. This is the first release of the latest project in the Camel’s ecosystem, based on an [LTS camel release](/blog/2020/03/LTS-Release-Schedule/). 

 * The main features of this release are:
 * Introduction of aggregation support
 * Introduction of marshalling and unmarshalling support on both sink and source connectors
 * Upgrade to the latest Apache Camel release 3.4.2
 * Addition of new examples in the camel-kafka-connector-examples repository
 * Integration tests added for HDFS (sink), Cassandra/CQL (source), Slack (Source), JDBC (sink) and MongoDB (sink/source).

This project is still under heavy development but we are already at a good point in stabilizing the codebase. Expect new features and improvements in the next releases!
