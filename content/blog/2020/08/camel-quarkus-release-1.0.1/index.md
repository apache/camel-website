## What's next?

Camel Quarkus 1.1.0 will be released shortly after Camel 3.5.0. We will possibly release some candidate releases (CRs)
depending on the availability of Camel 3.5.0 CRs.

To get an idea which new extensions are coming, look for the extensions
having `since = 1.1.0` in the [list of extensions](/camel-quarkus/next/reference/index.html).
