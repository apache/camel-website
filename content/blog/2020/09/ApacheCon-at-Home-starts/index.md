[ApacheCon @Home](https://www.apachecon.com/acna2020/index.html) starts
tomorrow, here is how to make the most of it.

First, if you haven't already registered there is still time, go over to the
[conference page](https://www.apachecon.com/acna2020/index.html) to do so. It's
free (small donation encouraged)!

Browse the [track
schedule](https://www.apachecon.com/acah2020/tracks/camel.html) and use the
calendar icon to import the session calendar entry in your calendaring
software, this way you'll be reminded when a session you don't want to miss is
about to start.

Take advantage of different ways to participate in discussions and network
during the conference. Chat [on Slack](http://s.apache.org/apachecon-slack) by
hopping over to the [#camel
channel](https://apachecon.slack.com/archives/C018EK9AXAN). Here you can invite
the folk to further discussions in ad-hoc sessions, enabled each day after the
end of scheduled sessions. Also, after the sessions, join the "BoF Oasis" and
make this our hallway or water cooler meeting place.

Do you have something to share? Submit your 10-minute lightning talk on the
[track page](https://www.apachecon.com/acah2020/tracks/camel.html#R1735).

Be sure to participate by asking questions on the session chat. We'll try to
get to as many questions as the time allows at the end of each session.
