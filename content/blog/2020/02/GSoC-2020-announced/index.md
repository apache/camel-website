preview: Google Summer of Code 2020 announced, we're looking for ideas and mentors
---
A few days ago Google Summer of Code announced that [Apache Software
Foundation](https://apache.org) is again elected to participate as a [mentor
organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5919474722537472/).

We are looking for **ideas**, **students** and **mentors** willing to
participate in GSoC 2020.  Anyone in the Camel community can propose an idea,
look at the [JIRA issues labeled
gsoc2020](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-11994?jql=project%20%3D%20CAMEL%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20gsoc2020%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC)
or create new issues with ideas and set the
[`gsoc2020`](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CAMEL%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20help-wanted%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC)
label. Have a look at the [Mentor
guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) to understand the role of
the mentor and the obligations you would take on.

**Students**, please take the time to familiarize yourself with the Camel
project, look into subprojects and find areas that are interesting for you to
participate in. Camel covers a wide range of interesting technologies and
challenges, typical areas of contribution are improvements to existing
[components](/components/latest/), adding [new
components](http://localhost:1313/manual/latest/writing-components.html) or
doing improvements to the core of Camel. There are exciting developments if
you're interested in Kubernetes in the [Camel K](/camel-k/latest/), fast
startup and low memory footprint in [Camel
Quarkus](/camel-quarkus/latest/), or stream processing in [Camel
Kafka](/camel-kafka-connector/latest/) subprojects. Also look for issues
labeled with
[`help-wanted`](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CAMEL%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20help-wanted%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC)
for easy issues to get started with to gain some experience contributing to
Camel and introduce yourself to the Camel community.

**Mentors** need to be existing [Camel
comitters](https://projects.apache.org/committee.html?camel) and need to apply
by first sending an email to the
[private@camel.apache.org,mentors@community.apache.org](mailto:private@camel.apache.org,mentors@community.apache.org)
as in the following example:

```
To: private@camel.apache.org
cc: mentors@community.apache.org
subject: GSoC 2020 mentor request for <mentor name>

Camel PMC,

please acknowledge my request to become a mentor for Google Summer of
Code 2020 projects for Apache Camel.
