Yesterday Claus Ibsen presented a webinar where he covered all the latest innovations with Apache Camel
with focus on Camel Quarkus, Camel K, and Kamelets. This trio is a powerful combination that takes Camel
to another level, which allows non developers and IT professionals, to manage and bind systems together without
any Camel knowledge. 

Kamelets being the Apache Camel solution for an _app store experience_ with integration software.
