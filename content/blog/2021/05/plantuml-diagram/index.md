Hello Camel riders!

I created a tool which allows to draw a PlantUML activity diagram from a **running** Camel context (not at design time).

The above image shows what kind of diagram you can expect.

I find it useful when I need to have a overall view of interactions between all the routes and endpoints, 
or to have a visual representation for better understanding and documentation.

You can find all the details on the public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ncasaux/camel-plantuml).

Maybe some of you could find it useful too! Do not hesitate to provide your feedback!
