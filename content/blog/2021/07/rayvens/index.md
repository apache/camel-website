We're happy to learn that a new open source project has been launched to add integration capabilities to AI applications.

Built on [Ray](https://ray.io/) and *Apache Camel*, [Rayvens](https://github.com/project-codeflare/rayvens) from [@IBMResearch](https://twitter.com/IBMResearch) enables data scientists to interface with hundreds of data services with little effort to consume, process, and produce events and data in real time.

The project perfectly fits the mission of Camel K of bringing event sources and sinks to any platform that needs data.
