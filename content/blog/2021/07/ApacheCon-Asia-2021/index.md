[ApacheCon Asia 2021](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/) will be held online from 6 August to 8 August. As a track chair of [the integration track](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/tracks/integration.html), I will be presenting the topics related to integration and [the conference registration](https://hopin.com/events/apachecon-asia-2021) is now open.

Integration is the method and technology of integrating heterogeneous systems built on different platforms and with different solutions. The most famous application integration project at the ASF is [Apache Camel](/), which has a variety of projects providing a variety of integration solutions. This time, the [ApacheCon Asia 2021](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/) integration track brings you the latest information on the Apache Camel project, so follow me now and take a peek!

For those of you who don't know much about [Apache Camel](/) yet, I suggest you check out [Claus](https://twitter.com/davsclaus) and [Andrea](https://twitter.com/oscerd2)'s presentation on [Apache Camel 3: The next generation of enterprise integration](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/zh/sessions/1071.html), [Claus](https://twitter.com/davsclaus) and Andrea](https://twitter.com/oscerd2) are the lead developers on Apache Camel and [Claus](https://twitter.com/davsclaus) is the author of [Camel in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/camel-in-action-second-edition?). They led the development of Apache Camel 3, so in this talk they will present many of the latest developments on Camel 3, as well as the new members of the Camel family:

* [Camel K](/camel-k/next/) is a serverless integration platform that can be deployed on top of K8S, enabling low-code/no-code functionality and the ability to quickly stitch together large numbers of Camel connectors with the power of integration patterns.
* [Camel Quarkus](/camel-quarkus/next/) organically integrates [Apache Camel](/manual/index.html) integration capabilities with its [component library](/components/next/index.html) and [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/)  runtime, so that we can enjoy the performance gains of application loading, [developer fun](https://quarkus.io/vision/developer-joy) and [container-first](https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first) benefits that [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) provides while doing application integration development.

By leveraging [Knative](https://knative.dev/), [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/)' fast runtime and [Camel K](/camel-k/next/); we can implement a cloud-native, serverless integration platform: such as auto-scaling, shrink-to-zero and event-based communication capabilities, as well as the powerful integration capabilities of Apache Camel. You can build and maintain an army of Camels to solve your cloud-native problems with [Christina Lin](https://twitter.com/Christina_wm)'s [Building and Maintaining an Army of Camels to tackle your cloud native problems](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/sessions/1070.html), which shows you how to develop a cloud-native integration application using [Camel Quarkus](/camel-quarkus/next/)and [Camel K](/camel-k/next/) with concrete examples from IDE tools, testing frameworks, scaling instances, configuration, CI/CD processes and finally monitoring.

For those who want to learn more about the implementation details of [Camel Quarkus](/camel-quarkus/next/) in Chinese, you can follow [the introduction of Camel Quarkus](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/zh/sessions/1072.html) by [Feng Zheng](https://twitter.com/amos_zhengfeng), who will introduce the basic concept of [Camel Quarkus](/camel-quarkus/next/)  and how to improve application loading performance by using [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/)' build time optimization.

With the popularity of event-driven architectures in cloud-based web services, services are increasingly being integrated through event response, and [Nicola Ferraro](https://twitter.com/ni_ferraro) has recently implemented a very handy set of [Kamelets](/camel-k/next/kamelets/kamelets.html) on top of [Camel K](/camel-k/next/). With Kamelets, developers can leverage the 300+ components provided by Apache Camel to Use yaml to define their own cloud-based application integration scripts and deploy them to k8s with the tools provided by [Camel K](/camel-k/next/). For further details on using Kamelets, follow [Nicola Ferraro](https://twitter.com/ni_ferraro)'s talk [From Camel to Kamelets: new connectors for event-driven applications](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/sessions/1073.html).

[Tadayoshi Sato](https://twitter.com/tadayosi) proposes the idea of integration scripting by combining Apache Camel with [JBang](https://jbang.dev). He demonstrates how easily we can write an intergration with the combination. For those who would like to know more about the idea, you can follow [Tadayoshi Sato](https://twitter.com/tadayosi)'s talk [Integration as a Script - Integration made easy with Apache Camel and JBang](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/sessions/1074.html).

In addition to the cool features of [Apache Camel](/) described above, we have invited other speakers to share [how Huawei Cloud ROMA uses Apache Camel](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/sessions/1075.html), [Apache Project ARM build](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/sessions/1086.html), and topics related to [Apache Open Meeting integration](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/sessions/1075.html). You can visit the [Integration track page](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/tracks/integration.html) for more information on these sessions.
