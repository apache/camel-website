As we [announced earlier](/blog/2021/03/ApacheCons2021/) this year, we have not one but two Apache conferences featuring Apache Camel on the Integration track.

[ApacheCon Asia](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/) is from August 6 - 8, 2021 and has [two days](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/tracks/integration.html) of Camel and software integration sessions held in Asia-Pacific timezone. And [ApacheCon @Home](https://apachecon.com/acah2021/) from September 21 - 23, 2021 also features two days of Camel and software integration sessions with sessions held in Europe-Americas timezone.

The schedules for the Integration track at [ApacheCon Asia](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/tracks/integration.html), and [ApacheCon @Home](https://apachecon.com/acah2021/tracks/integration.html) have been published, and are packed with interesting technology talks and use case presentations.

This is also a great time to register to attend [ApacheCon Asia](https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/register.html) or [ApacheCon @Home](https://apachecon.com/acah2021/register.html).

Both conferences are free to attend and online/virtual, so come and celebrate with the Apache Camel and the wider Apache Software Foundation community.
