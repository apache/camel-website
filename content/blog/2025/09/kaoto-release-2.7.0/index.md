## Whatâ€™s New in Kaoto 2.7?

We're excited to announce the release of Kaoto 2.7, bringing significant enhancements to the visual integration design experience for Apache Camel. This release focuses on expanding DataMapper capabilities, improving developer productivity, and delivering a more intuitive canvas experience.

## Here are the key highlights of this release

### DataMapper JSON Support
One of the most significant additions in Kaoto 2.7 is comprehensive JSON support for the DataMapper. Building on the XML support introduced in previous releases, the DataMapper now enables you to:

* Serialize and deserialize JSON data structures for visual mapping
* Attach JSON schemas to visualize data structures in tree view
* Create mappings between JSON and XML formats
* Choose root elements when working with schemas containing multiple root elements

### Updating maven dependencies
When using the VS Code Kaoto extension, upon saving the route, the necessary maven dependencies get added to the pom.xml file

* Copy steps and entire containers across your routes

* Enhanced visual feedback during move operations
