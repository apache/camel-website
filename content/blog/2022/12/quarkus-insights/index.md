A few weeks ago I presented Camel JBang at the Quarkus Insights show 
and one of the demos I did was to quickly run Camel 1.0 route copied with the latest Camel.

This is a [4-minute recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTak5jC9Oko) of that demo. 

If you want to see more, then I recommend to watch the [Quarkus Insight session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stBjGMu73B0).
