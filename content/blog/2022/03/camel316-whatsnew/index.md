Apache Camel 3.16 has just been [released](/blog/2022/03/RELEASE-3.16.0/).

This release introduces a set of new features and noticeable improvements that we will cover in this blog post.

### Resume from Offset

This release brings a new API to simplify consuming data at scale: the resume API V2. Please check the [blog post](/blog/2022/03/resume-api-v2/) we wrote to introduce it to our community.

### Load properties from valut/secrets cloud services

This release brings a new feature: the ability to retrieve properties values from a Vault/Secrets cloud services.
We are currently supporting AWS Secret manager service and Google Secret Manager, but we are planning to add more.

See more details at the following [blog post](/blog/2022/03/secrets-properties-functions/)

### Camel Main

We added base package scanning support when running a Camel Main application, that
makes it easier to auto-discover Camel routes, configuration classes, type converters,
and other classes using dependency injections.

A new `camel-test-main` module added to make it easier to unit test Camel Main based applications.

### Camel JBang

We continue to innovate and make running Camel quickly and easily with JBang better and better.
Now `camel-jbang` supports reloading `.properties` files in reload mode.

We also added support for loading `.java` source containing custom POJOs, processors,
or type-converters which can be reloaded. This allows users to modify the source code,
and let `camel-jbang` hot re-load changes.

The `camel-jbang` now also supports Camel K _modeline_ configurations, and other parts
from Camel K & Kamelets, that makes camel-jbang more on-par with Camel K and makes it possible to
run many more Camel K files out-of-the-box.

And we also made `camel-jbang` auto download DSLs, so for example It's possible to run a kotlin
source file and automatic download the needed `camel-kotlin-dsl` JAR.

A preliminary support for using dependency injection annotations from Spring, Quarkus, and CDI
has been added, which bridges the gap between camel-jbang and using Camel K, Camel Spring Boot,
or Camel Quarkus. The intention is to allow getting started with building Camel integrations
using `camel-jbang` / [Camel Karavan](https://github.com/apache/camel-karavan) and then
later transition to a regular Camel on Spring Boot or Quarkus project.
We will continue working on this story for upcoming releases.

See more details at the [Camel JBang documentation](/manual/camel-jbang.html)

### Camel UI Designer

The [Camel Karavan](https://github.com/apache/camel-karavan) project is progressing nicely, and during the development we have identified
a number of _mistakes_ in the route model in Camel that has been improved and corrected.

This overall makes it easier to build custom Camel tooling as there are less _model hacks_ you may need to
implement in the tool.

The changes to the model may affect users when upgrading, so make sure to read the [upgrade guide](/manual/camel-3x-upgrade-guide-3_16.html).

### Camel Health Checks

The `camel-health` has been overhauled to be made simpler to implement custom health-checks.

### Camel Route Templates

The XML, Spring XML, Java and YAML DSL now also support creating routes from route templates.

Assuming that you have a simple route template whose id is `someTemplate` with one template parameter `message`, according to the DSL of your choice, you can create a new route from this template as next:

In Java DSL
```java
templatedRoute("someTemplate")
    .parameter("message", "Hello Camel templated route!");
```

In Spring XML DSL
```xml
<camelContext>
    <templatedRoute routeTemplateRef="someTemplate">
        <parameter name="message" value="Hello Camel templated route!"/>
    </templatedRoute>
</camelContext>
```

In XML DSL
```xml
<templatedRoutes xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <templatedRoute routeTemplateRef="someTemplate">
        <parameter name="message" value="Hello Camel templated route!"/>
    </templatedRoute>
</templatedRoutes>
```

In YAML DSL
```yaml
- templated-route:
    route-template-ref: "someTemplate"
    parameters:
      - name: "message"
        value: "Hello Camel templated route!"
```

### Component Headers

Most of the components produce or consume headers so like endpoints' options, it was important to provide some tooling to generate the documentation of the headers in a standardized way. 

For this, we added a new element called `headersClass` to the annotation `@UriEndpoint` in order to provide the class that holds all the name of headers as `String` constants. Generally, it is the class whose name is of type *xxxConstants* where *xxx* is the name of the corresponding component like for example `FtpConstants` for the component camel-ftp.

Then, in the headers class, each constant defining the name of a header, is then annotated with `@Metadata` to provide its documentation like for the options. 

We started [^1] marking up all headers in every component for automatic generation of documentation, but also to expose the metadata of the headers to external tools.

[^1]: For now, only the headers of components whose name starts with A to G have been documented.

### Camel Kafka

We added specific health-checks for kafka producer and consumers that checks the kafka-client
internals if the connectivity with the kafka brokers is healthy or not.

We did other bug fixes, and we continue to make the camel-kafka component more robust. In this release we fixed offset management issues. Please check the release notes for details.

### Quarkus

The upcoming Camel Quarkus 2.8 release will be upgraded to Camel 3.16. 

### Spring Boot

We have upgraded to the latest Spring Boot 2.6 release.

Added more unit tests to various starter JARs to increase the QA of this project.

## Deprecated Components: Camel Testcontainers

In this release we are replacing the camel-testcontainers components with the camel-test-infra. These new set of test-related components simplify integration testing with Camel, allow us to test edge case scenarios more easily, reduce our maintenance effort and more. Please check the [blog post](/blog/2022/02/camel-test-infra/) where we explained about the changes.

## Upgrading

Make sure to read the [upgrade guide](/manual/camel-3x-upgrade-guide-3_16.html) if you are upgrading from a previous Camel version.
