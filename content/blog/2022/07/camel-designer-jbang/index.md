A new input mapping system has been added to *Camel Designer*. But what that even means ?!?

Well, better to be seen, but if explained, it's an effort to provide a more intuitive configuration system for *Camel* route steps. On one hand, it simplifies the view of a route by compacting route steps, and on the other hand, it provides an easy drag-and-drop mapping ability to map process variables to activity inputs.

For example, to configure an endpoint, such as an HTTP activity, the mapping view allows the developer to configure a full HTTP invocation by mapping component options, headers and payload.

## Detailed blog article

To really understand how this new configuration system works, head to the following blog post that deep dives into it:

- [**Gearing up _Camel Designer_**](https://brunonetid.github.io/2022/06/28/camel-designer-configuration.html)

In the blog above, this new functionality is covered in great detail. Furthermore, it showcases how combining *Camel Designer* and [***Camel JBang***](/manual/camel-jbang.html) empowers the developer to code with super fast trial-and-error cycles. The combo shines when used for exploratory work and prototyping.


## Quick video demonstration

If you're not that interested in the nitty-gritty details, here's a video recording showcasing *Camel Designer* and *Camel JBang*, walking you through the process of building and running one of the examples included in the blog article.
