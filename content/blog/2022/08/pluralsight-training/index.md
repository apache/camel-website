## Announcing Author-led Training on Camel

I'm happy to announce the release of a new course on Apache Camel at Pluralsight. The course, "Fundamentals of Integration with Apache Camel", by Michael Hoffman, is intended to help you learn the foundations of Camel as well as how to apply it at an enterprise scale. Demonstrations are provided for implementing ETL, Event-Driven Architecture with RabbitMQ and Kafka, and finally, serverless with Camel-K. Please note, Pluralsight is a paid subscription service.

The course can be found at, [Fundamentals of Integration with Apache Camel](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/apache-camel-fundamentals-integration).

You can also find source code for the course in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pluralsight-camel/fundamentals-of-integration-with-apache-camel).
