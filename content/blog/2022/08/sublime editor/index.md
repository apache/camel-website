Two weeks before it became easier to provide language support inside coc.nvim -[See this blog post](/blog/2022/07/coc-nvim-camel-lsp/). It is now the case for sublime, thanks to [camells](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-sublime).

It is an [extension for camells](https://github.com/sublimelsp) to enable [Apache Camel language server](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-language-server) support.

# Camel Language Server Support Demo

For instance, code completion for XML with Camel DSL. The capabilities are based on the [Camel Language Server](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-language-server/).
