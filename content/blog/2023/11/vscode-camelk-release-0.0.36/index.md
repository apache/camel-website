There is a new release of VS Code extension [Tooling for Apache Camel K](https://github.com/camel-tooling/vscode-camelk/blob/0.0.36/CHANGELOG.md#0036) 0.0.36. Available at [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-camelk) and [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/redhat/vscode-camelk).

The list of new features is short but they are very important and required important rewrite. Here they are:

# Compatibility with Camel K 2

It is the first version compatible with Camel K 2.x stream.

It is picking by default Camel K 2.1.

# Java standalone file support on Windows

The support of standalone Camel Route written with Java DSL is now available (and tested) on Windows.

Thanks to [@JonathanDavies626](https://github.com/JonathanDavies626) for reporting the missing functionality.
