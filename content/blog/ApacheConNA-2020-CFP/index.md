As [previous year](../ApacheConNA-2019/) Apache Camel is part of ApacheCon
2020 in North America. This year the conference will be held at the [Sheraton,
in New Orleans](https://apachecon.com/acna2020/location.html), September 28th
through October 2nd, 2020.

The call for presentations for ApacheCon North America 2020 is [now
open](https://apachecon.com/acna2020/cfp) and the wider Camel community
members are encouraged to submit. Look for the **Camel/Integration** track
when submitting.

We're most interested to see talks that offer a learning experience to the
attendees, so talks that present new parts of the Camel ecosystem (Camel K,
Camel Quarkus, Camel Kafka Connector), talks showing off lessons learned, use
cases, and visions on where software integration is heading in the future.

**The call for presentations will close Friday, May 1, 2020 8:00 (America/New
York time).**

Submit early, submit often, at
[https://apachecon.com/acna2020/cfp](https://apachecon.com/acna2020/cfp)
