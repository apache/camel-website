---

It's the time of the year where we take a look back at 2019, and compile a brief summary of the Apache Camel project.

The big news of 2019 was the much anticipated release of Apache Camel 3.

## Family of projects

It was also in 2019 that the Camel project became a family of projects by introducing:

- Camel K
- Camel Quarkus


Making Apache Camel a trilogy. But it does not stop there; in early 2020 three will become five when we release:

- Camel Kafka Connector
- Camel Spring Boot (moved out from main repository)
