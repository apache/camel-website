preview: Apache Camel 3 is end of life
---

Apache Camel is officially end of life by end of 2024.

We have just [released](/blog/2024/12/RELEASE-3.22.3/) the last Apache Camel 3.22.3 release of Camel 3.x.
There will NOT be any more releases and support for Camel 3 is end of life.

There will not be any new releases of Camel 3.x, and users are encouraged to start new development
on Camel 4, and plan to [migrate existing applications](/blog/2023/10/migrate4/) to Camel 4.x.

We have done a total of 78 Camel 3.x releases, since Camel 3.0.0 was released (november 2019) 5 years ago.
