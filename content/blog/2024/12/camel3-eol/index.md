---

Apache Camel is officially end of life by end of 2024.

We have just [released](/blog/2024/12/RELEASE-3.22.3/) the last Apache Camel 3.22.3 release of Camel 3.x.
There will be NO further releases, and support for Camel 3 has officially reached its end of life.

There will not be any new releases of Camel 3.x, and users are encouraged to start new development
on Camel 4, and plan to [migrate existing applications](/blog/2023/10/migrate4/) to Camel 4.x.

We have done a total of 78 Camel 3.x releases, since Camel 3.0.0 was released (November 2019) 5 years ago.
