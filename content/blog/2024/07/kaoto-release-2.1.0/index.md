<br/><strong>
After the previous 2.0 GA release, we are happy to announce the release of Kaoto 2.1, packed with exciting new features, bug fixes, and various improvements to enhance the user experience.

This update introduces the capability to choose your preferred Runtime version among other notable upgrades. Read on to discover the key highlights of this release and how they can improve your workflow with Kaoto.
</strong>

## New Features

- Catalog: Empower users to pick a runtime and specific version to display the right components with their precise configurations. This means you can tailor your catalog to fit your exact runtime version, ensuring compatibility. Additionally, the catalog can be generated dynamically, allowing you to show different runtimes in the Runtime selector, such as Quarkus and Spring Boot. This dynamic generation is the first step towards fully customizing the Apache Camel catalog used by Kaoto.
