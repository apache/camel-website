Apache Camel 4.6 has just been [released](/blog/2024/05/RELEASE-4.6.0/).

This release introduces a set of new features and noticeable improvements that we will cover in this blog post.

## Camel Core

## Camel Main

## Camel JBang

We fixed some issues using Camel JBang with Windows, but we would still like more feedback from Windows users.

## Rest DSL with contract first 

## Miscellaneous

Upgraded many third-party dependencies to the latest releases at the time of release.

## New Components

This release only brings two new components:  

- `camel-google-pubsub-lite` - Send and receive messages to/from Google Cloud Platform PubSub Lite Service.
- `camel-pinecone` - Perform operations on the Pinecone Vector Database.

## Upgrading

Make sure to read the [upgrade guide](/manual/camel-4x-upgrade-guide-4_6.html) if you are upgrading from a previous Camel version.

If you are upgrading from, for example, 4.0 to 4.4, then make sure to follow the upgrade guides for each release in-between, i.e.
4.0 -> 4.1, 4.1 -> 4.2, and so forth.

## Release Notes

You can find more information about this release in the list of JIRA tickets resolved in the release:

## Roadmap

The following 4.7 release (non LTS) is planned to upgrade to Spring Boot 3.3, and to be released in July.
