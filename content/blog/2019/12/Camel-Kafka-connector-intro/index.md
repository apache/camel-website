The Apache Camel community introduces a new subproject in the ecosystem: Camel-Kafka-Connector. This project born as a PoC exploring the possibility of leveraging the Apache Camel components as Kafka source and sink connectors.
The main idea behind the project is reusing the Camel Components' flexibility in a simple way, through a configuration file mixing Kafka Connect configuration and Camel route definitions and options.

### What is Kafka Connect?

It is an Apache Kafka's framework that defines a standardized way to stream data in and out a kafka broker. In Kafka connect a user can define source and sink connectors to stream data, respectively, in and out a kafka broker.
This framework features:

- _Distributed and standalone mode_
- _Rest interface_
- _Automatic offset management_

### Kafka connect key concepts

- _Connector_: generally refer to a source/sink implemented using kafka connect framework.
- _SinkConnector_ / _SourceConnector_: are responsible to setting up the connector and partitioning the work by creating SinkTask / SourceTask.
- _SinkTask_ / _SourceTask_: are responsible to handle the actual work.
- _Key_ / _value converter_: a component able to convert the key or value of a kafka message from a format to another.
- _Transformer_: a component able to manipulate a message.
