severity: MODERATE
summary: "Apache Camel-Bean component: Camel Message Header Injection via Improper Filtering"
description: "This vulnerability is only present in the following situation. The user is using one of the following HTTP Servers via one the of the following Camel components: camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http and camel-netty-http and in the route, the exchange will be routed to a camel-bean producer. So ONLY camel-bean component is affected. In particular: The bean invocation (is only affected if you use any of the above together with camel-bean component) and the bean that can be called, has more than 1 method implemented. In these, limited and particular, conditions an attacker could be able to forge a Camel header name and make the bean component invoking other methods in the SAME bean. The vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with 'Camel', 'camel', or 'org.apache.camel.'."
mitigation: "Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases. Also, users could use removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like 'cAmel, cAMEL' etc, or in general everything not starting with 'Camel', 'camel' or 'org.apache.camel.'. "
