type: security-advisory
cve: CVE-2026-25747
severity: HIGH
summary: "Apache Camel: Camel-LevelDB: Unsafe Deserialization from LevelDBAggregationRepository"
description: "The Camel-LevelDB DefaultLevelDBSerializer class deserializes data read from the LevelDB aggregation repository using java.io.ObjectInputStream without applying any ObjectInputFilter or class-loading restrictions. An attacker who can write to the LevelDB database files used by a Camel application can inject a crafted serialized Java object that, when deserialized during normal aggregation repository operations, results in arbitrary code execution in the context of the application."
mitigation: "Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.0, which fixes the issue. If users are on the 4.10.x LTS releases stream, then they are suggested to upgrade to 4.10.9. If users are on the 4.14.x LTS releases stream, then they are suggested to upgrade to 4.14.5."
credit: "This issue was discovered by Andrea Cosentino from Apache Software Foundation"
affected: From 3.0.0 before 4.10.9, from 4.11.0 before 4.14.5, from 4.15.0 before 4.18.0.
fixed: 4.10.9, 4.14.5 and 4.18.0
