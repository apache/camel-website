# Apache Camel security information

## Reporting new security problems with Apache Camel

The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating security problems.

We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to the private security mailing list of the ASF Security Team, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Please see the [page of the ASF Security Team](https://www.apache.org/security/) for further information and contact information.
