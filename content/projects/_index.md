## Apache Camel K

Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures. Users of Camel K can instantly run integration code written in Camel DSL on their preferred cloud (Kubernetes or OpenShift).

For more information checkout the [Camel K manual](/camel-k/latest/) and join the community on on the [Camel Users mailing list](/community/mailing-list/) and have a look at the [Camel K GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/camel-k/).


## Apache Camel Kafka Connector

Camel Kafka Connector allows you to use all Camel [components](/components/latest/) as [Kafka Connect](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect) connectors, which as result expands Kafka Connect compatibility to include all Camel components to be used in Kafka ecosystem.  

For more information checkout the [Camel Kafka Connector manual](/camel-kafka-connector/latest/) and join the community on the [Camel Users mailing list](/community/mailing-list/) or chat on [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/apache/camel-kafka-connector) and have a look at the [Camel Kafka Connector GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/camel-kafka-connector/).


## Apache Camel extensions for Quarkus

This project hosts the efforts to port and package the 280+ Camel components as Quarkus extensions. [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) is a Java platform offering fast boot times and low memory footprint. It targets both stock JVMs (OpenJDK in the first place) and GraalVM.

For more information, please refer to the [Camel Quarkus Documentation](/camel-quarkus/latest/) or check the [Camel Quarkus code](https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/) on GitHub.


## Apache Camel Spring Boot Starters

Camel support for Spring Boot provides auto-configuration of the Camel and starters for many Camel components. Our opinionated auto-configuration of the Camel context auto-detects Camel routes available in the Spring context and registers the key Camel utilities (like producer template, consumer template and the type converter) as beans. 

For more information, please refer to the [Camel Spring Boot Starters Manual](/camel-spring-boot/latest/).

## Apache Camel Karaf

Makes running Apache Camel in [OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/) container nicely using [Apache Karaf](https://karaf.apache.org/).

For more information checkout the [Camel Karaf manual](/camel-karaf/latest/).
