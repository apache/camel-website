# Apache Camel extensions for Quarkus

This project hosts the efforts to port and package the 280+ Camel components as Quarkus extensions.

[Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) is a Java platform offering fast boot times and low memory footprint. It targets both stock JVMs (OpenJDK in the first place) and GraalVM.

For more information, please refer to the [Camel Quarkus Documentation](../../camel-quarkus/latest/) or check the [Camel Quarkus code](https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/) on GitHub.
