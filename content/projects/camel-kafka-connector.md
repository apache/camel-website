# Apache Camel Kafka Connector

Camel Kafka Connector allows you to use all Camel [components](../../components/latest/) as [Kafka Connect](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect) connectors, which as result expands Kafka Connect compatibility to include all Camel components to be used in Kafka ecosystem.  

For more information checkout the [Camel Kafka Connector manual](../../camel-kafka-connector/latest/) and join the community on the [Camel Users mailing list](../../community/mailing-list/) or chat on [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/apache/camel-kafka-connector) and have a look at the [Camel Kafka Connector GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/camel-kafka-connector/).
