Welcome to the 2.19.0 release which resolved over 670 issues including
new features, improvements and bug fixes.

* Introduced
Camel Connector's which is a simplified version of a Camel component that has
been pre-configured for a specific use-case.
* Upgraded to Spring Boot 1.5.x.
* The Camel Maven Plugin now provides the
`camel:validate` goal to parse your Java and XML source code for any
Camel routes and report invalid Camel endpoint uri and simple expression
errors. You can run this at code time (not runtime). 
* Camel `Main` and Spring Boot
and Camel Maven Plugin can now auto
terminate the JVM after Camel has been running for maximum duration of
seconds, processed messages or been idle for a period.
* Camel source code can build with Java 9 in preparation for official
support for Java 9 in a future release
* All the Camel Spring Boot starter components now has more of the
components default values included in their metadata which allows
tooling to display such information
* Deprecated more components and camel-core APIs that will be dropped in
Camel 3.0 or sometime in the future
* Introduced `ReloadStrategy` as SPI which allows custom providers to
implement logic for triggering live reloads of Camel routes.
* The Camel Maven Plugin now allows to
live reload route changes from XML files when running Camel. This can
also be enabled from the `Main` class.
* Introduced a new `camel-catalog-rest` artifact which is a tiny
standalone REST API of the CamelCatalog using JAX-RS and Swagger
Annotations.
* Added `camel-catalog-rest-app` as a standalone application which used
Apache CXF with Jetty to host the Catalog REST API with embedded Swagger
UI
* Returning `null` from Bean should work similar to
how `setBody` and `transform` works when they set a `null` body.
* The Camel Spring Boot starter components now have their auto
configuration depends
on `org.apache.camel.springboot.CamelAutoConfiguration` which makes it
easier writing unit tests where you can
exclude `org.apache.camel.springboot.CamelAutoConfiguration` to turn off
Camel Spring Boot auto configuration completely.
* Camel now supports OWASP dependency check maven plugin
* NATS component now supports TLS and explicit flushing
(with timeout) of the connection
* Metrics component
now supports Gauge type
* File consumer now supports idempotent-changed and
idempotent-rename read lock strategies for clustering. 
* Camel Catalog now supports custom runtime providers that only includes
the supported Camel components, languages and data formats running in
that container. For example for Karaf or Spring Boot in the
camel-catalog-provider-karaf and camel-catalog-provider-springboot.
* The bean
component will when calling a method that returned an instance of
`Callable` now call that callable to obtain the chained result. This
allows to call Groovy functions/closures etc.
* Failover Load Balancer with
inheritErrorHandler=false, now allows
Error Handler to react after the load
balancer is exhausted.
* Salesforce component now supports limits, recent
items, approvals and composite API
* Dumping Camel routes as XML now includes custom namespaces which are
at xpath expressions etc. Likewise updating Camel routes from XML can
now include namespaces which will be associated on xpath expressions.
* Added `RouteIdFactory` which can auto assign route ids based on the
consumer endpoints to use more sensitible names, instead of route1,
route2, etc.
* Add `skip` function to Simple language
* Upgraded to Jetty 9.3 (Jetty 9.2 still supported for Karaf 4.0.x
users)
* `RouteBuilder` auto-configuration can now be disabled
from Camel CDI configuration
* Camel contexts automatic start can now be disabled
from Camel CDI configuration
* Camel CDI now provides support
for `TransactionErrorHandler` and `TransactionPolicy` via JTA
* Asynchronous support for CXF JAX-RS producers has
been added
* The JSonPath language now supports Map and List
types and POJOs as well. For POJOs you need to have Jackson on the
classpath. 
* Data Format which marshal to JSon or XML now
set the content-type header to application/json or application/xml
appropriately. 
* The Kafka component can now store offset state
offline (stateRepository) to preserve this information and be able to
resume from previous offset.
* The Kafka component has been improved to be easier to
configure and use. Notice there is a backwards incompatible change so
users need to migrate.
* A topic based idempotent repository that
is Kafka based for
the Idempotent Consumer EIP
* The Kafka component will automatic type convert the
message body to the type specified by the configured serializer (is
string by default) when sending to kafka. You can also now configure key
and partitionKey in the endpoint uri, instead of having to specify as
headers.
* The Kafka consumer will now auto commit on stop to
ensure the broker has the latest offset commit. The
option `autoCommitOnStop` can be configured to be sync,async or none.
* Added easy predicate parser to JSonPath to more
easily define simple predicates without using the more complex jsonpath
notation with all the symbols
* The Box component has been migrated to use the Box v2
Java API as the old v1 API is going to be shutdown from summer 2017
* Examples overview now generate from the source code to ensure its up
to date
* Added declarative Transformer 
and Validator
which performs transformation/validation according to the data type
information declared on a route by
inputType and/or outputType.
There're a few examples demonstrates this feature:
camel-example-transformer-blueprint, camel-example-transformer-cdi, camel-example-transformer-demo,
and camel-example-validator-spring-boot
* Added query support for JPA Producer

The following issues have been fixed

* Fixed starting Camel on Oracle JDK 1.8.0_19 or lower, which would
throw an UnsupportedOperationException
* Fixed running `mvn camel:run` when using OSGi Blueprint
* Fixed Hystrix EIP to also execute fallback if
execution was rejected or short-circuited or other reasons from
Hystrix. 
* Fixed Hystrix EIP race condition when timeout
was hit and fallback is executed could let to Camel Exchange having
wrong caused exception.
* Fixed adding new routes to running CamelContext and if the new routes
would fail to startup, then before these routes would "hang around". Now
only succesful started routes are added.
* Adding or removing routes that starts
from Undertow no longer restart the entire HTTP
server
* VM endpoint should prepare exchange with the
CamelContext from the consumer and not from cached endpoint which can be
different
* Fixed a bug when using Rest DSL
with SERVLET could cause a java.io.IOException:
Stream closed exception when using Bean component in the route. 
* Fixed an issue when using `pipeline` in Java DSL not setting up the
EIP correctly which could lead to runtime route not as intended.
* Fixed Dropbox to
use Stream caching to avoid reading entire
file into memory so Camel can process big files
* Fixed `toD` issue with splitting uris when RAW values had + sign
* Fixed adviceWith may behave differently when using multiple advices in
the same order and you would advice on the same nodes.
* Fixed camel-zipkin to be able to startup and
work with Camel XML 
* Fixed FTP2 readLock=changed not working (when
fastFileExists=false) if no sub folder was specified as starting
directory.
* Fixed Simple language when using indexing with a
nested function
* Fixed issue with `@Consume` not having `CamelContext` injected and its
lifecycle managed by `CamelContext`
* Fixed Netty double buffer release leak in Netty4
and Netty4 HTTP

API breaking

* The groovy DSL from camel-groovy has been moved into its own
camel-groovy-dsl module. The camel-groovy now only contains the Camel
Language
* Camel-spring-LDAP now uses `java.util.function.BiFunction<L, Q, S>`
instead
of `org.apache.camel.component.springldap.LdapOperationsFunction<Q, S>`
* The deprecated APIs from camel-spring-boot has been removed as part of
upgrading and supporting Spring Boot 1.5.x
* The `getComponentDocumentation` method on `CamelContext` is deprecated
and returns null. The embedded HTML documentation in all the Camel
components has been removed as they are not in use/maintained, and the
JSon schema is the actual information. Use the camel-catalog for
component documentation where you can get all the documentation in both
ascii doc and html format.
* camel-mongodb-gridf schema has been renamed
from *gridfs* to *mongodb-gridfs* to avoid confusion.
* The commands-core has the Catalog commands removed
* The org.apache.camel.spring.boot.FatJarRouter has been removed, just
use regular `RouteBuilder` classes in Spring Boot applications.
* The Kafka endpoint option
`seekToBeginning=true` should be migrated to `seekTo=beginning`
* The Kafka endpoint option bridgeEndpoint has moved from endpoint to
the KafkaConfiguration class so all options are together.
* The Kafka component has been improved to be easier to
configure and use. Notice there is a backwards incompatible change so
users need to migrate. The kafka uri is changed from kafka:brokers to
kafka:topic. So you need to specify the topic name in the context-path
and the brokers as parameters, eg before
`kafka:myserver?topic=sometopic` is
now `kafka:sometopic?brokers=myserver`
* The Infinispan uri syntax has changed from
infinispan:hostName?options to infinispan:cacheName?options

Important changes to consider when upgrading

* camel-spring-dm has been disabled from the karaf features file so
users cannot install it out of the box as it does not work properly.
camel-spring-dm has been deprecated for a long time and users are
encouraged to use osgi blueprint instead. The JAR is still shipped and
can be installed manually but then you are on your own. The JAR will be
removed completed in a future release.
* Groovy DSL and Scala DSL is deprecated and planned to be moved to
Camel Extra and not distributed out of
the box in the future.
* Camel now uses Karaf 4.x API and therefore not possible to run on
older Karaf versions.
* `camel-blueprint` changed startup behavior to start on
Blueprint.CREATED event which would be more `correct` way of startup
instead of Blueprint.REGISTERED as before.
* camel-spring-boot now don't include prototype scoped beans when auto
scanning for RouteBuilder instances, which is how camel-spring works.
You can turn this back using the includeNonSingletons option.
* camel-spring-javaconfig removed from Karaf features as it was not
really supported in OSGi/Karaf.
* camel spring-boot shell commands have been removed as spring-boot
shell has been deprecated in spring-boot.
* camel-mongodb-gridf schema has been renamed from gridfs to
mongodb-gridfs to avoid confusion.
* camel-box has been migrated to use box v2 api so there may be some
migration needed as the old camel-box component was using box v1 api
* The JSon schema from camel-catalog have changed to use boolean,
integer and numeric values when applicable instead of using string
values for everything. 
* The camel-catalog Karaf commands has been removed
