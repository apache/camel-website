# Apache Camel Website <img alt="Apache Camel" src="antora-ui-camel/src/img/logo-d.svg" height="30 px">

This is a site generator project for Apache Camel. It generates static HTML and
resources that are to be published.

Tools used to generate the website:
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) a source code management tool used to fetch document sources from different
   github repositories.
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) a JavaScript runtime used to build the website. You will need to use Node.js version 10.
 - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) a blazing fast dependency and package manager tool used to download
   and manage required libraries.
 - (installed via yarn) [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) a task automation tool. Used to build the Camel
   Antora UI theme.
 - (installed via yarn) [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) a static site generator. Simplified, it takes the
   documentation from the `content` directory and applies templates from `layouts`
   directory and together with any resources in `static` directory generates output in
   the `public` directory.
 - (installed via yarn) [Antora](https://antora.org/) a documentation site generator. It uses
   Asciidoc documents from different sources in the [Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel),
   [Camel K](https://github.com/apache/camel-k) and [Camel Quarkus](https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus)
   repositories where user manual and component reference documentation resides and renders them for inclusion in this
   website.
 - (optional) [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) a build tool used to run the complete website generating process

## Build with Node and yarn

You can build the website locally using the tools `Node.js` and `yarn`.

If you can not use these tools on your local machine for some reason you can also build the website using Maven as
described in section ["Build with Maven"](#build-with-maven).

### Preparing the tools

### Chocolatey

For windows users, a beginning step to install yarn and nvm on your local system is through installing chocolatey. 

An easy step to step guide to install chocolatey on your local system is as follows: 
1. Open cmd/powershell and run it as administrator. 

2. Install with cmd.exe 

        > @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command " [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"

3. Install with PowerShell.exe 

        > Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

#### Node

Make sure that you have Node.js (herein "`Node`") installed.

    $ node --version

If this command fails with an error, you do not have Node installed.

This project requires the Node LTS version 10 (e.g., v10.15.3).

Please make sure to have a suitable version of Node installed. You have several options to install
Node on your machine.

### Installation of nvm on Linux/Mac OS

- Install using the Node version manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- Install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Node formulae](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node)
- Install from official [Node packages](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

An easy step to step guide to install nvm and install node v10.0.0 on your local system is as follows: 

    $ touch ~/.bash_profile
    $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.1/install.sh | bash
    $ source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    $ nvm install 10.0.0


Note - If you have different Node version other than Node LTS version 10 you can use following command to make
Node LTS version 10 as default Node version.

    $ nvm use 10.0.0

### Installation of nvm on Windows 

Note - The following steps need to be ran on cmd as administrator only. 

An easy step to step guide to install nvm and install node v10.0.0 on your local system is as follows: 

    > choco install nvm
    > nvm install 10.0.0

Note - If you have different Node version other than Node LTS version 10 you can use following command to make
Node LTS version 10 as default Node version.

    > nvm use 10.0.0


Now that you have Node 10 installed, you can proceed with checking the Yarn installation.

#### Yarn

Follow [the documentation on installing](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) Yarn for your Operating system.

> Note: For windows users, run on cmd as administrator and install yarn through chocolatey.

#### Clone and Initialize the project

Clone the Apache Camel Website project using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/apache/camel-website.git

The command above clones the Apache Camel Website project. After that you can switch to the new
project directory on your filesystem.

## Build the Antora Camel UI theme

First step is to build the Antora ui theme used for the Apache Camel website. The theme sources are located
inside [Project root directory/antora-ui-camel](antora-ui-camel). So first switch to that directory:

    $ cd antora-ui-camel

In that directory execute:

    $ yarn install # needed only once, or if dependencies change
    $ yarn build   # to perform the ui theme build

You should see the Antora theme bundle generated in in [antora-ui-camel/build/ui-bundle.zip](antora-ui-camel).

The Camel Antora UI theme should not be a subject to change very frequently. So you might execute this once and
never come back.

## Build the website content

Building the website requires the built Antora Camel UI theme bundle from above. Please check that
the theme bundle exists in [antora-ui-camel/build/ui-bundle.zip](antora-ui-camel).

To build the website go to the project root directory and run:

    $ yarn install # needed only once, or if dependencies change
    $ yarn build   # to perform the build

This should fetch doc sources for [Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel) and [Camel K](https://github.com/apache/camel-k)
and generate the website with Hugo. You should see the generated website in the `public` directory.

## Preview website locally

You can preview the Apache Camel website on your local machine once you have the generated website available in
the `public` directory.

Hugo can start a simple web server serving the generated site content so you can view it in your favorite browser.

Simply call

    $ yarn preview

and you will be provided with a web server running the site on [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/)

Point your favorite browser to `http://localhost:1313/` and you will see the Apache Camel website.

Changes that are made to the content managed by Hugo (i.e. content, layouts, config.toml) are applied automatically and reloaded in the browser. To make changes to the content managed by Antora, a rebuild needs to be done. The same is true for the CSS changes in the `antora-ui-camel`. To rebuild you can run, in another terminal window, from the root directory of the website:

    $ (cd antora-ui-camel && yarn build) && yarn antora --require ./menu.js site.yml

This will build the `antora-ui-camel` which holds all the CSS and JavaScript, and then rebuild the documentation, resulting in an updated content in the `documentation` directory.

To iterate quickly, it's easier to make changes directly in the browser tooling and then bring the changes over to the CSS files after the fact.

## Contribute changes

The Apache Camel website is composed of different sources. So where to add and contribute changes in particular?

### Changes on the website

#### Menu

The site main menu is defined in the top level configuration [config.toml](config.toml). You can add/change
menu items there.

#### Content

The basic website content is located in [content](content). You can find several different directorys representing different
areas of the website:

- [docs](content/docs): Getting started, user manual, component reference
- [download](content/download): Download Camel artifacts
- [blog](content/blog): Blog posts
- [community](content/community): Support, contributing, articles, etc.
- [projects](content/projects): Subproject information (e.g. Camel K)
- [security](content/security): Security information and advisories
- [releases](content/releases): Release notes

#### Adding new blog post

Use the `blog` archetype to create a new markdown content file in `content/blog`:

    $ yarn hugp new --kind blog blog/URL-SLUG/index.md # replace URL-SLUG with URL slug for the blog post

Put a nice featured image in `content/blog/URL-SLUG/featured.png` and edit `content/blog/URL-SLUG/index.md` filling in the details.

Don't forget to remove `draft: true` to publish the blog post.

#### Adding new security advisory content

Use the `security-advisory` archetype to create a new markdown content file in `content/security`:

    $ yarn run hugo new --kind security-advisory security/CVE-YYYY-NNNNN # replace YYYY-NNNNN with the CVE number

This will create a `content/security/CVE-YYYY-NNNNN.md` file which you need to edit to and fill in the required parameters.
The content of the created markdown file is added to the _Notes_ section.

Place the signed PGP advisory in plain text as `content/security/CVE-YYYY-NNNNN.txt.asc`.

Make sure that you set the `draft: false` property to have the page published.

#### Adding new release note

Use the `release-note` archetype to create a new markdown content file in `content/releases`:

    $ yarn run hugo new --kind release-note releases/release-x.y.z # replace x.y.z with the release version

This will create a `content/release-x.y.z.md` file which you need to edit to and fill in the required parameters.
The content of the created markdown file is added to the _New and Noteworth_ section.

Make sure that you set the `draft: false` property to have the page published.

#### Layout and templates

Layout related changes go into [layout](layout) directory where you will find HTML templates that define the common layout
of the different page categories including footer and header templates.

### Changes in Antora UI theme

The Antora UI theme basically defines the look and feel of the website. You can find the theme sources within this
repository in [antora-ui-camel](antora-ui-camel).

You need to rebuild the Antora UI theme in order to see your changes reflected locally.

### Changes for Camel and Camel K docs

The Apache Camel website includes documentation sources from other github repositories. Content sources are defined in
[site.yml](site.yml).

At the moment these are the documentation sources from [Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel)
and [Camel K](https://github.com/apache/camel-k). These are basically the component reference docs and the Camel user
manual. In case you want to change something here, please go to the respective github repository and contribute your
change there.

- [Camel components](https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/docs/components)
- [Camel user manual](https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/docs/user-manual)
- [Camel K docs](https://github.com/apache/camel-k/tree/antora/docs)

Your changes in these repositories will automatically get visible on the website after a site rebuild.

## Build with Maven

The project provides a simple way to build the website sources locally using the build tool [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

The Maven build automatically downloads the tool binaries such as `node` and `yarn` for you. You do not need to install
those tools on your host then. The binaries are added to the local project sources only and generate the website content.

As the Maven build uses pinned versions of `node` and `yarn` that are tested to build the website you most likely avoid
build errors due to incompatible versions of `Node.js` tooling installed on your machine.

### Preparing Maven

Make sure that you have Maven installed.

    $ mvn --version

If this command fails with an error, you do not have Maven installed.

Please install Maven using your favorite package manager (like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)) or from
official [Maven binaries](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

### Building from scratch

When building everything from scratch the build executes following steps:

- Download `yarn` and `Node.js` binaries to the local project
- Load required libraries to the local project using `yarn`
- Build the Antora Camel UI theme ([antora-ui-camel](antora-ui-camel))
- Fetch the doc sources from [Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel)
  and [Camel K](https://github.com/apache/camel-k) github reporsitories
- Build the website content using Hugo

You can do all of this with one single command:

    $ mvn package

The whole process takes up to five minutes (time to grab some coffee!)

When the build is finished you should see the generated website in the `public` directory.

### Rebuild website

When rebuilding the website you can optimize the build process as some of the steps are only required for a fresh
build from scratch. You can skip the ui theme rendering (unless you have changes in the theme itself).

    $ mvn package -Dskip.theme

This should save you some minutes in the build process. You can find the updated website content in the `public` directory.

### Clean build

When rebuilding the website the process uses some cached content (e.g. the fetched doc sources for
[Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel) and [Camel K](https://github.com/apache/camel-k) or the Antora ui theme).
If you want to start from scratch for some reason you can simply add the `clean` operation to the build which removes
all generated sources in the project first.

    $ mvn clean package

Of course this then takes some more time than an optimized rebuild (time to grab another coffee!).
